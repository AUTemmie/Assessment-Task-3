<H1>Assessment Task 3</H1>

<H2>Objective</H2>
<p>Designing a socially interactive learning platform that facilitates academic collaboration and resource sharing. The website should serve as a digital hub (like discord) but for topics that are related to education, promoting engagement through support from peers and study materials. 
<H2>Functional requirements</H2>
<ol>
    <li>Users should be able to create accounts and have secure login and logout processes. </li>
    <li>Users should be able to configure their personal data; avatars, biographies, usage statistics. (e.g. student IDs )</li>
    <li>Private messaging infrastructure, with real-time communication channels between users. (Private and public study groups)</li>
    <li>Find peers studying similar subjects, and groups or people who have the same interests.</li>
</ol>
<H2>Non-Functional requirements</H2>
<ol>
    <li>Consistency aesthetically pleasing elements (color, typography, spacing). Should have a high contrast readability. </li>
    <li>Streamlined and intuitive navigation structure. Should be easy for our age groups (Middle school to Uni) to use and access.  </li>
