# Assessment-Task-3

<H1>Assessment Task 3</H1>

<h1>Week 1<h1>
<H2>Objective</H2>

<p>Designing a socially interactive learning platform that facilitates academic collaboration and resource sharing. The website should serve as a digital hub (like discord) but for topics that are related to education, promoting engagement through support from peers and study materials.

<H2>Functional requirements</H2>
<ol>
    <li>Users should be able to create accounts and have secure login and logout processes. </li>
    <li>Users should be able to configure their personal data; avatars, biographies, usage statistics. (e.g. student IDs )</li>
    <li>Private messaging infrastructure, with real-time communication channels between users. (Private and public study groups)</li>
    <li>Find peers studying similar subjects, and groups or people who have the same interests.</li>
</ol>

<H2>Non-Functional requirements</H2>
<ol>
    <li>Consistency aesthetically pleasing elements (color, typography, spacing). Should have a high contrast readability. </li>
    <li>Streamlined and intuitive navigation structure. Should be easy for our age groups (Middle school to Uni) to use and access.  </li>
    <li>Cloud-based scalability to support increasing user loads. This minimizes crashes and makes sure the website doesn't slow down as more students and other members of community continue to access our website. </li>
</ol>

<h1>Week 2<h1>
<H1>Design Prototype 1</H1>

<H2>Login Page</H2>
<p>Displays 3 interactive buttons to sign in; may change to just a sign up page for easier navigation and less workload.

Branding is clearly evident on top left and right side of page; colour scheme for branding is questionable; definite change in the future using AI.

Design is a little simplistic, may include gradient-forms or different designs; still unknown. </p>

![alt text](images/LoginPage.png)

<H2>Home Page</H2>
<p>Once you sign in, you will be redirected to this page.

Quick links to: All, Friends, Groups, Other, Direct Messages.

\*Inspired by Discord.

Shows current friends and friends you can add; Interactive elements when you click on groups and DMs.

Notifications: Non-interactive. If too much workload may not include.

</p>

<H2>Direct Messages Page</H2>
<p>Once you click on someone in DMs, you will be directed to this page.

Shows:

- people.
- Activity.

Interactions:

- Communication.

Still shows quick links for easy access.

</p>

<H2>Profile Page</H2>
<p>Customise user settings:
1. Picture
2. Username
3. Phone Number
4. Email

Those buttons like “privacy and safety” are non-functional requirements.

Quick links are still here.

Logout will send you back to the login page.

</p>

<h1>Week 3<h1>

<H1>Design Prototype 2</H1>

<h2>LoginPage</h2>

<p>Changed the login page to look a lot more minimalistic and formal. Looks more pleasing to the eye than original design as original design looked very boring and rather goofy.</p>

![alt text](images/1.png)

<h2>DashboardPage</h2>

<p>The idea of the dashboard was to move away from an inherently different version of discord to a more original concept and idea of a study social network. The Minopus dashboard is designed to allocate resources to how much learning is done rather than just communication with friends and people. </p>

![alt text](images/2.png)

<h2>DMPage</h2>

<p>DM page remains relatively similar apart from the adition of the sidebar, which not only is a minimalistic look but also a very simple navigation tool that will allow users to move around the application freely. Most communication bits will remain the same as they have a nice look but also don't stray from what I plan to do. </p>
