# Assessment-Task-3

<H1>Assessment Task 3</H1>

<h1>Week 1<h1>
<H2>Objective</H2>

<p>Designing a socially interactive learning platform that facilitates academic collaboration and resource sharing. The website should serve as a digital hub (like discord) but for topics that are related to education, promoting engagement through support from peers and study materials.

<H2>Functional requirements</H2>
<ol>
    <li>Users should be able to create accounts and have secure login and logout processes. </li>
    <li>Users should be able to configure their personal data; avatars, biographies, usage statistics. (e.g. student IDs )</li>
    <li>Private messaging infrastructure, with real-time communication channels between users. (Private and public study groups)</li>
    <li>Find peers studying similar subjects, and groups or people who have the same interests.</li>
</ol>

<H2>Non-Functional requirements</H2>
<ol>
    <li>Consistency aesthetically pleasing elements (color, typography, spacing). Should have a high contrast readability. </li>
    <li>Streamlined and intuitive navigation structure. Should be easy for our age groups (Middle school to Uni) to use and access.  </li>
    <li>Cloud-based scalability to support increasing user loads. This minimizes crashes and makes sure the website doesn't slow down as more students and other members of community continue to access our website. </li>
</ol>

<H2>Colour Palette</H2>

| Changing Element  | Description            |
| ----------------- | ---------------------- |
| Typography        | Instrumental Sans      |
| Image/Icon Choice | Using AI or web images |

| Hex Code | Purpose                         |
| -------- | ------------------------------- |
| #212A31  | background colours              |
| #2E3944  | outlines and background colours |
| #124E66  | more vibrant sections           |
| #748D92  | design and text                 |
| #D3D9D4  | text                            |
| #FFFFFF  | text                            |

<h1>Week 2<h1>
<H1>Design Prototype 1</H1>

<H2>Login Page</H2>
<p>Displays 3 interactive buttons to sign in; may change to just a sign up page for easier navigation and less workload.

Branding is clearly evident on top left and right side of page; colour scheme for branding is questionable; definite change in the future using AI.

Design is a little simplistic, may include gradient-forms or different designs; still unknown. </p>

![alt text](images/LoginPage.png)

<H2>Home Page</H2>
<p>Once you sign in, you will be redirected to this page.

Quick links to: All, Friends, Groups, Other, Direct Messages.

\*Inspired by Discord.

Shows current friends and friends you can add; Interactive elements when you click on groups and DMs.

Notifications: Non-interactive. If too much workload may not include.

</p>

![alt text](images/HomePage.png)

<H2>Direct Messages Page</H2>
<p>Once you click on someone in DMs, you will be directed to this page.

Shows:

- people.
- Activity.

Interactions:

- Communication.

Still shows quick links for easy access.

</p>

![alt text](images/DMPage.png)

<H2>Profile Page</H2>
<p>Customise user settings:
1. Picture
2. Username
3. Phone Number
4. Email

Those buttons like “privacy and safety” are non-functional requirements.

Quick links are still here.

Logout will send you back to the login page.

</p>

<h2>Wireframe</h2>

<p>This essentially shows where each page can be directed to. </p>

<h1>Week 3<h1>

<H1>Design Prototype 2</H1>

<h2>LoginPage</h2>

<p>Changed the login page to look a lot more minimalistic and formal. Looks more pleasing to the eye than original design as original design looked very boring and rather goofy.</p>

![alt text](images/1.png)

<h2>DashboardPage</h2>

<p>The idea of the dashboard was to move away from an inherently different version of discord to a more original concept and idea of a study social network. The Minopus dashboard is designed to allocate resources to how much learning is done rather than just communication with friends and people. </p>

![alt text](images/2.png)

<h2>DMPage</h2>

<p>DM page remains relatively similar apart from the adition of the sidebar, which not only is a minimalistic look but also a very simple navigation tool that will allow users to move around the application freely. Most communication bits will remain the same as they have a nice look but also don't stray from what I plan to do. </p>

<h1>Week 4<h1>

<h1>Test Cases</h1>

<h2>Test Case 1</h2>

<h2>Login and Signup Algorithm</h2>
<p>Use this image to help you understand test cases above.</p>

<h1>Week 5</h1>
<p>
<ol>
<li><strong>what data do you want stored during the use of your app? </strong>
For users: First Name, Last Name, email, password, gender, UserID. For Conversation: ConversationID, UserID, Message Text, Message Sent Date. For groups (extension) GroupID, Name, Description, Member Count.</li>

<li><strong>what date you want displayed on your front end?</strong>
Firstname in the dashboard and chat, email and password in settings.</li>

<li><strong>what data is related to each other - needing keys set-up for each table</strong>
The userID is related to convesation as to send messages, and is also related to groups if you want to join groups.</li>

<li><strong>what data types should for elements be in your database (text, numeric, image etc)</strong>
image files and text files. </li>

<li><strong>what queries might you need to write (between and across tables) allowing for good information storage and retrieval</strong>
Queries to show information relevant to the signing in and up of a user. </li>

</ol>
</p>

![alt text](images/5queries.png)

<p>These queries represent different ways to fetch information from the database</p>
<ol>
<li>Query 1 sees all conversation</li>
<li>Query 2 sees users who use gmail for signup</li>
<li>Query 3 shows those who's passwords are below 5 digits, which is not very safe.</li>
<li>Query 4 specifically selects a piece of conversation of 1 user 47.</li>
<li> Query 5 selects from conversation who messaged "lorem".</li>
</ol>

<h1>Week 6</h1>

<p>Beginning of development, start backend development; setting up python. </p>

<h1>Week 7 + 8</h1>

<h2>Website design</h2>

<h3>Login Page</h3>

<p>The login page displays a new design somewhat similar to the previous design, although due to personal preference this design is kept because of better aesthetics.</p>

![alt text](images/LoginPageFinal.png)

<h3>Signup Page</h3>

<p>The signup page was a newly created idea for the user to send critical information to the database as a login in order to access the rest of the features of the application.</p>

![alt text](images/SignupPageFinal.png)

<h3>Dashboard Page</h3>

<p>Dashboard page references the colour scheme that was explained above in the document, although with a slight change in the blue gradients for a lighter effect. The dashboard shows a sidebar with different catagories; Dashboard, Chats, Friends, Resources, Settings </p>

![alt text](images/MainPageFinal.png)

<h3>Chat page</h3>

<h1>Week 9</h1>

<p>Worked through the final steps document. The login page works by reviewing information stored in the database and checking if it matches what you write in the criteria parts. The signup page works in a similar way by storing information into the database for later signing in use. Finally, the search bar in the "friends" section uses javascript to filter out names, although not very helpful if there is a lack of friends. </p>
<p>The test cases have all been tested and work!

<h1>Week 10</h1>
<p>Lighthouse Reports</p>

![alt text](images/DashboardLighthouse.png)

![alt text](images/ChatsLighthouse.png)

![alt text](images/FriendsLighthouse.png)

![alt text](images/ResourcesLighthouse.png)

![alt text](images/LoginLighthouse.png)

<p>As you can see, accessibility and SEO at most of the times are between 90-100, unlike performance and best practices which remain steady at 100. The lighthouse reports show that there is mostly no problem in the pages of the application.

<h1>Week 11</h1>
<p>Client testing</p>
<ul>
<li>Positive</li>
<li>Negative</li>
</ul>
